# INT-NN

A nerual network library based on pure C, using only integer arithmetic, designed for embedded systems and low-power devices.

Final Project for "Machine Learning Systems" course at Fudan University.

## Setup
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- CMake
- GCC

Then, simply run:
```bash
build.bat
```

## Result
The train/test will as follows and it is replicable:
```
Final training accuracy: 97.00%
Final test accuracy: 96.77%
```
